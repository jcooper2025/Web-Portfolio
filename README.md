This repo is the code for my online portfolio.

The only links are to my first two Udacity projects. A movie trailer website and a small online database project. 

All of the images are personal photos except for the logo. It was pulled from google public images.

As of 10/31/2017 there is only html, bootstrap css and javascript, and images. 
The initial project consists of a static web page with links to the git repositories of my projects. 
Since there is no executable code and no webserver code the web page can be displayed as a local file.

To view the project down load the repository as a zip file and extract it or clone it to a local directory.
